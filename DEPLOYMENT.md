# Sentiment Analyzer Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checks

- [x] All dependencies listed in requirements.txt
- [x] NLTK resources properly handled with fallbacks
- [x] Feature dimension mismatch handled appropriately
- [x] Negation handling working correctly ("not bad" â†’ positive)
- [x] Emoji sentiment incorporated into analysis
- [x] Testing script validates the critical cases

## Fixed Issues

- [x] Incorrect sentiment classification for negative phrases with emojis
- [x] VADER neutral scores overriding negative/positive signals
- [x] Text preprocessing issues (NLTK tokenization failures gracefully handled)
- [x] Feature dimension mismatches (model expects 5000, text vectors can be different)

## Deployment Steps

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on the deployment system
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
3. Run `python setup_nltk.py` to download all NLTK resources
4. Run `python start_app.py` to start the Streamlit server

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. Test with example phrases from sampletext file
2. Ensure negative phrases with emojis are correctly classified
3. Verify "not bad" type phrases are classified as positive
4. Check that mixed sentiment text has reasonable classification

## Known Limitations

- Dimension mismatch between model and feature extraction (5000 vs 5008)
  - Currently using a fallback mechanism, but ideally model should be retrained
- NLTK tokenization occasionally fails, but system falls back to simple tokenization
- Very brief texts may have less accurate sentiment analysis

## Future Improvements

- Retrain model with current feature extraction for perfect alignment
- Expand rule-based patterns for more complex sentiment expressions
- Add more detailed explanation of sentiment factors in UI
- Implement more robust NLTK error handling and reporting
